To enable Cache feature in your application you have to follow these simple steps.

# Add Cache Section to appSettings.json file

First of all, add the settings to your appSettings file, as in the example:

```json
{
  "UmbrellaCache": {
    "AdmitNullValues": false,
    "MinutesLifeTimeDuration":  1
  }
}
```

For more information, see UmbrellaCacheSettings.cs

# Enable Cache capabilities at startup (Net6.0)

To enable the feature, use this simple snippet:

_Simple configuration_
In this scenario you use the simplest cache provider based on dictionary.

```c#
builder.Services.AddCache(builder.Configuration);
```

_Microsoft In-memory Cache_
In this scenario you are using the Microsoft implementation of Cache.

```c#
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftCache(builder.Configuration);
```

_Microsoft Distributed Cache_
In this scenario you are using the Microsoft implementation of Distributed Cache provided by Redis.

```c#
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftDistributedRedisCache(builder.Configuration);
```

in such cese, the appSettings has to be modified a bit:

```json
{
  "UmbrellaCache": {
    "AdmitNullValues": false,
    "MinutesLifeTimeDuration": 1,
    "ConnectionString": "my-conn-str",
    "InstanceName": "my-name"
  }
}
```
